# rCash - online mobile banking

## Goal : Practice JavaScript knowledge by building a fictional mobile banking app.

## Technology : JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Git

### How the app works

- User can cash in
- User can cash out through an Agent
- User can send money to other users
- User can see his transactions and Balance
- After 10 minutes, if there are no activity user will automatically log out

#### Note : This is for practicing JavaScript, so no real life data will be used and all the things including login will be fake. Again This is just a practice project, so don't look for clean code, architecture, design pattern or any kinds of framework

#### I've already designed an initial flowchart and layout mockup for this application which has been included in the repository

#### About flowchart and repository :

- This is just for initial planning
- While working on this project, I may add or remove something

## Timeline

- 28/10/2025 - I've created the repository, Started Designing Homepage - finished balance and cashout section
- 29/10/2025 - I've added a new section in homepage, I've decided just to go with cash out and send money section for now, not thinking about cash in
